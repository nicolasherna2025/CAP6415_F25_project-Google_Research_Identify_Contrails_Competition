CAP6415_F25 PROJECT
WEEK 2 LOG


Project: Participate in Kaggle Competition “Google Research - Identify Contrails to Reduce Global Warming”


The second week consisted mainly of literature review. The topics researched were:


Image Segmentation: The competition asks to identify contrails for each pixel in the image, so image segmentation is necessary for this project. Different algorithms of segmentation were researched, the most popular were Convolutional Neural Networks [5] [8], but also looked into code for segmentation using ViTs [9]. From the research, there is more research for CNN but it would be interesting to compare the performance of CNN to ViTs for contrail detection.   
   
Temporal Context: For better recognition of contrails, the competition offers temporal context, so multiple images before and after the labeled image. To include this context I researched information that includes spatio-temporal encoding and decoding [10], Inflated 3D CNN [11].
 
Related Work: I also researched previous work in contrail detection using satellite images. [1] [2] [3] [4] [7] which helped guide the types of networks people have used, which can guide the best implementation that can be used to get a good performance,and a good experimental option could be to implement a ViTs that is something that has not been as documented as CNNs.
