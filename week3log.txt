CAP6415_F25 PROJECT
WEEK 3 LOG


Project: Participate in Kaggle Competition “Google Research - Identify Contrails to Reduce Global Warming”


The third week consisted of working with the data set to get it ready to implement a 3D convolutional neural network, and perform a first test using a simple network to get some first results. 


The data in kaggle consists of a training folder with 20.5k folders representing record id, for each record id, there are 9 folders for each band (band_08 to band_16) and each band folder contains an array (256, 256, 8). These are sequences of 8 images of size 256x256 representing temporal context, like a video. Each record id also holds a human_pixel_masks.npy, which is an array (H, W, 1) that is the per pixel binary ground truth. 


Accomplishments during this week included loading the data set, and transforming the data set into necessary pytorch tensors of shape (C,T,H,W) -> (9, 8, 256, 256). This was done inside the class torch.utils.data.Dataset to later use the Dataloader, to train with batches.


For a first test I implemented a simple 3D CNN of an encoder decoder:
Encoder:
* Conv3D (in=9, out=16, kernel=3)
* BatchNorm3D
* ReLU
* Conv3D (in=16, out=16, kernel=3)
* BatchNorm3D
* ReLU  
Output: (4, 16, 8, 256, 256)


Temporal Collapse:
torch.mean(x, dim=2)
Output: (4, 16, 128, 128)


Decoder:
* Conv2D (16 → 32)
* BatchNorm2D
* ReLU
* Conv2D (32 → 16)
* BatchNorm2D
* ReLU
* Conv2D (16 → 1, kernel=1)
Output: (4, 1, 128, 128)


Loss function: BCEWithLogitsLoss


Model was evaluated on the global Dice coefficient

Results:
Final Validation Results
Loss: 0.03540554323538753
Dice: 0.25215517715749347

To do: research algorithms ato improve model, like a 3D U-Net, use ViTs, add temporal attention.
